import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react'

// The core spoiler mechanism (see brief §7b — this behavior must not drift).
//
// A sealed value is NEVER in the render tree until reveal. `children` is a
// render function that produces the revealed content; it is only invoked in
// the revealed branch, so before reveal there is no fetched-then-hidden DOM
// node holding a score.
//
// Reveal is one-directional: once revealed it stays revealed (a stray
// double-tap can't flash-and-rehide). Global reveal is driven via
// `forceRevealed`. Re-sealing on inning navigation is handled by the parent
// remounting this component with a fresh key.
// `onReveal` (optional) fires exactly once, the moment this box becomes
// revealed — by tap or by the global flag. It runs after reveal, so anything it
// reads (e.g. this half's linescore, to feed the running line) is still only
// touched post-reveal, honoring the spoiler rule.
// `label` names what the cover hides ("Tap to reveal the box score") — it is
// the sealed button's accessible name, so keep it spoiler-free and specific.
// `coverless`: render NOTHING while sealed instead of the kraft cover button —
// for a surface that reveals from elsewhere (the innings view's bottom-bar
// button). The spoiler guard is unchanged: children are still only invoked once
// revealed, so nothing sealed reaches the DOM; only the tap-target cover is
// dropped.
// `compact`: a thinner, button-like cover (see .sealbox--compact in
// index.css) for a surface that doesn't need the full-height kraft-tape
// treatment — currently just the slate's Top Performers box. Purely a class
// modifier; the reveal mechanism below is identical either way.
